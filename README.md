# User Manual for G12 Checkers
## Creators : Connor Van Etten | Esmeralda Xhyliu | Tytionna Williams



## Opening Program
Since our checkers is a web based app, all you have to do is visit my Github Pages [link](https://crvanetten15.github.io/CheckersWebApp/) to test it out!

## Run Game
First select whether you would like to play with a friend or solo, against our computer player.
If Player versus Player is selected on the main menu, you will be redirected to a page with a checkers board, a scoreboard and indications of whos turn it as a header. If Player versus Computer is selected the page you are directed to is identical but the logic of gameplay is much different.

## PVP MODE
If PVP mode is selected both you and your friend (or enemy) will take turn choosing a piece and then selecting a open space from the highlighted locations. Only possible moves are highlighted when a piece is selected and no piece on the other team will move if it is not their turn. This limits confusion when playing.

## PVC MODE
If PVC mode is selected you are directed to face our computer challenger. You by default have the starting move. when a piece is selected you have the option to click on the highlighted squares to place your cleckers piece. As soon as you place your piece our AI scans for it's best move and will play you back. This process will continue until the game is completed.

## Rules
Our last tab on our main menu includes the rules to checkers. IF you do forget please refer to this page to make sure you have a good understanding of the game.
